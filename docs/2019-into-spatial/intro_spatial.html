What is Data Analysis?

&gt; Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.

Key idea of spatial data:

&gt; The closer two locations are in space, the more highly correlated observations taken at those locations will be.

- We can relate this to another concept we all understand.

- The closer you are in generations, the more related you will be to another individual
- Queen to her kids, to their kids, to THEIR kids
- Prince whats-his-face to his siblings, to his uncle, cousin, second cousins, etc.

- Similarly, with spatial correlation we mean that

# Spatial Data Analysis

The process of:

- Inspecting, cleaning, and modeling geo-located data 
- With the goal of discovering useful information or making conclusions
- While accounting for the fact that closer locations are more highly correlated.

More than just modeling data that *could* be mapped.

???


- For example, we could run a regression on the relationship between gun homicide and gun ownership rates

???

- That's not a **spatial** analysis, because we didn't actually use the location of the states.

- They just plotted gun deaths by gun ownership and ran a simple regression.

- Doesn't recognize that West Virginia and Boring Virginia are right next to each other.

- And there may not be anything wrong with that! Maybe there isn't much spatial correlation in these data.

- How do we assess spatial correlation?

Geary's C:

# The General Linear Model

Recall the linear regression model

`$$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \varepsilon$$`

--

What are the typical assumptions for a regression analysis?

--

The random errors ( `\(\varepsilon\)` ) are:

- Normally distributed
- Have constant variance
- Are independent of each other


--

`\(\mbox{var}(\varepsilon_{i})=\sigma^{2}\)` and `\(\mbox{cov}(\varepsilon_{i}, \varepsilon_{j})=0\)`

--

No so for a spatial analysis!


???

- You don't have to know the details
- But getting the big picture here is important to understand what's going on.



---
# The General Linear Model

Alternative expression for the GLM:

`$$y \sim \mathcal{N}\left( X\beta , \sigma^{2}\mathbb{I} \right)$$`

--

&gt; The outcome `\(y\)` follows a Normal distribution with a mean of `\(X\beta\)` and a covariance matrix that is diagonal multiplied by a constant.

--

`\(X\beta\)`? Just a compact way to write `\(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{p}\)`

Covariance matrix? A big array that holds the variance for each point, and the covariance between points.

Simple example: Three counties

???

- Linear regression is a special case of what's called a general linear model
- One way to express the GLM is like this


---
# A Covariance Matrix


Consider the example of the flu vaccination rate for all WV counties

???

The answer depends on what type of spatial data we have.

- How we go about incorporating spatial dependence depends on the type of data we're collecting.

- What are some types of data? Numeric, Categorical, etc.

- What type of analysis would we use if ...

    - Response is numeric, predictor is numeric
    - Response is numeric, predictor is categorical
    - Response is categorical, predictor is numeric
    - Response is categorical, predictor is categorical

- There are also different ways in which data can be spatial

# Modeling Areal Data

Much Epidimiological data is areal in nature

--

May be something that only makes sense at an "area" level

- Number of cases of influenza per state
- State expenditures on Medicare or Medicaid
- Rate of preventable hospital stays by county

--

Sometimes an aggregation of spatial point process data

- Number of opiod overdoses for each county
- Average distance to grocery store
- Rate of uninsured adults


--

Key idea: 

&gt; Spatial dependence for areal data is modeled through the neighborhood matrix


???

- Incidence of flu. What would be the location of interest? =&gt; Where fly was contracted.
- May be reported at hospital, or home address. Is that really "the" location?
- Most sensible 'location' is probably ZIP code, county, state, ...

- So how does spatial dependence come into it?

# Neighborhood Matrix

A matrix that has a value of 1 when two locations are neighbors, and a 0 otherwise.

# Neighborhood Matrix: Variants

--

Instead of "Neighbor = 1" and "Non-neighbor = 0", we could ...

- Standardize the values (spatial weights) of the neighborhood matrix for **each** county

--

- Standardize the spatial weights across **all** counties

--

- Use alternative values for Neighbors

    - Inverse distance between county centroid (geographical center) or population mean centroid (population center)


???

- So how do we bring this into a spatial analysis?





---
# Areal Spatial Model

Recall the linear regression model (again!)

`$$Y \sim \mathcal{N}\left( X\beta , \sigma^{2}\mathbb{I} \right)$$`

If the data are areal spatial data, we update this model using the neighborhood matrix

--

Spatial CAR model:

`$$Y_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(  \gamma_{i}, \sigma^{2} \right)$$`

where

`$$\gamma_{i}|\mathbb{\gamma}_{-i} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \mu + \sum h_{ij}\left( \gamma_{j}-\mu \right), \tau^{2} \right)$$`

--

That looks complicated

--

It is complicated


???

- That looks complicated ... but it's just how we express the relatively intuitive idea in math

- Just like you may not have known all of the mathematical expressions when running regression, you don't need to know them all for running a spatial model.

- Maybe a picture will make more sense.

# Family Trees

.center[

&lt;img src="pictures/brit_family_tree01.jpeg" width="960" /&gt;

???

- The closer you are in generations, the more related you will be to another individual
- Queen to her kids, to their kids, to THEIR kids
- Prince whats-his-face to his siblings, to his uncle, cousin, second cousins, etc.
- Let's say that neighbors are either siblings, or up/down a generation, one "step" can put them all at the same person.

---

# Family Trees

.center[

&lt;img src="pictures/brit_family_tree02.jpeg" width="960" /&gt;

- So the Queen's grandchildren
- Each pair of siblings is neighbors, and they're *related* to each other but are not neighbors with their cousins, need to go up TWO generations to get to the same person.

---
# Family Trees

&lt;img src="pictures/brit_family_tree03.jpeg" width="960" /&gt;

- Then the kids of Princes William and Harry. William's kids are neighbors, and are related to Harry's kid to the same degree that William and Harry are related to their cousins.
- The four kids of William and Harry are also related to

# Family Trees

- But the relationship is more distant, they need to go up THREE generations to get to the same person.




---
# Areal Spatial Model

Another (still complicated) way to express this is:

`$$Y \sim \mathcal{N}\left( X\beta , \tau^{2}\left(\mathbb{I} - \phi\textbf{H}\right)^{-1} \right)$$`
--

Here:

- `\(\tau^{2}\)` is a non-saptial variance
- `\(\phi\)` is measure of spatial dependence
- `\(\textbf{H}\)` is the neighborhood matrix

Different approach to fitting the same model.

# Modeling Geostatistical Data

More difficult because there are infinitely many (possible) locations.

- No good version of the neighborhood matrix.

--

Solution: Impose a more simplified covariance model

`$$\mbox{cov}\left( Y(s_{i}), Y(s_{j}) \right) = C\left( d_{ij} \right)$$`

Covariance is a function of only the *distance* between two points.



---
# Modeling Geostatistical Data

Examples of `\(C(d_{ij})\)` include ...

- Exponential Covariance Model

`$$C(d_{ij}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\sigma^{2} e^{-\phi d_{ij}} &amp; \mbox{if } d_{ij} &gt; 0\\
\tau^{2} + \sigma^{2} &amp; \mbox{if } d_{ij} = 0\end{array}\right.$$`

--

- Matérn Covariance Model

`$$C(d_{ij}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\dfrac{\sigma^{2}}{2^{\nu-1}\Gamma(\nu)}\left(\phi d_{ij}\right)^{\nu}K_{\nu}\left(\phi d_{ij}\right)
&amp; \mbox{if } d_{ij} &gt; 0\\
\tau^{2} + \sigma^{2} &amp; \mbox{if } d_{ij} = 0\end{array}\right.$$`


Often a related concept, the *semivariogram* is what is actually modeled.

???

- The Exponential is a simpler model
- The Matern is more flexible, but is more complicated to use
- Both have several parameters, but there are three main concepts that get considered with geostatistical data

# Too Much Data

To produce that map, I didn't use the method I described

Why not?

- Problem: Number of observed locations is n = 12102

--

- Reason: Need to "invert" covariance matrix ... computationally expensive!

--

- Solution: Use a *reduced rank* spatial model

    - Model through a smaller set of spatial locations (called *knots*) across the domain

---
# Example: Too Much Data

- Total number of knot locations: r = 87

# Too Few Data

In some contexts, to few data is a problem. 

Recall our our WV maps

Some concerns:

- What if the outcome is rare?

- What if there is only once instance in a county?

- What if the outcome has *social* or *legal* implications?

]


???

- There may be times when it is irresponsible, inappropriate, or unethical to report the data in certain ways.
- Want to avoid being able to individually identify people.
- If rates of outcome are low ...

    - Might have unstable rates (is the reported rate even worth reporting?). 
    - Like a 51-49 "lead" in presidential race
    - Or a 50% increase in risk of cancer due to certain behavior. Raw rate being: 0.5% to 0.75%.
    
    - Aggregating to larger areas (zip code to county, county to state, etc) may give more reliable estimates.
    - But there may be too coarse, or have "edge effects".
    
- "Geographical epidemiology, spatial analysis and geographical information systems: a multidisciplinary glossary"
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2465628/

- Maybe you have more data, but it's on a different spatial grid, how to resolve?


---
# Different Areal Grids

Current research project: GAIL

--

Want: Produce maps and estimates of rate of some outcomes in WV, on a ZIP code level.

Have:

- Data on ZIP code level
- Data on PO Box ZIP code level

Problem:

- Outcome is rare
- Some regions in WV are very rural
- No inherrent match between PO Box and Standard ZIP codes.

--

One Approach:

- Randomly assign cases from one areal grid to the other
- Introduce some noise, but utilize more data



???

- GAIL = Geo-assignment of Irregular Locations
- Sometimes people combine by aggregating to the county level. Not desirable: Loss of granularity.
- Other times people throw out the PO Box ZIP codes. Not desirable: Loss of data, could be critical.

# Map Projections

Modern maps attempt to accurately represent the world

Need to *project* the globe onto flat surface

--

What features to preserve?

- Shape?
- Area?
- Distance?
- Direction / Angles?

--

Huh?

???

- Shape: Conformity, what a place would look like from directly above it
- Area: Size, how much of the map something take up
- Distance: How far apart two points on the surface are
- Direction/Angles: Which way is the shortest distance between two points.

    - For instance, an airplane flying from New York to Beijing will go near the North Pole, not so much over the Pacific Ocean.
    - So a "straight line" might not look straight on a map


---
# Map Projections

Consider two sets of locations:

- Set 1: Latitude  0 `\(^{\circ}\)` , Longitudes 50 `\(^{\circ}\)` E and 50 `\(^{\circ}\)` W
- Set 2: Latitude 42 `\(^{\circ}\)` , Longitudes 50 `\(^{\circ}\)` E and 50 `\(^{\circ}\)` W

# Map Projections

Choice of projection can retain various attributes

- Should shapes be the same?
- Should areas be the same?
- Should distances be the same?
- Should angles be the same?

&gt; Some attributes **will** be distorted, the map-maker must decide which attributes to portray accurately.

???

- For example, this next map shows two different projections
- Both have been relatively common (still are in some respects)

# Calculating Distances

- That only works because we can *project* vertically or horizontally without distorting distances

- Not so on a globe! We already saw an example of that

# Calculating Distances

]


???

- Both lines have the same x-coordinates, only different y-coordinates.

- Lower line is longer distance.

- Can think of an extreme example: Distance to walk around the Earth

     - On equator it's ... I don't know. Long.
     - If you walk in a circle that's 2 feet away from the south pole, though ...
     - Submarines sometimes do this as a kind of joke.

- So, calculating distances on a globe, how do we do it?

---
# Calculating Distances

How to calculate distance between these two points?

Euclidean plane

 - Use the Pythagorean theorem!

On a globe?

- Compute *geodesic* distance
- Need to use *spherical geometry*
- Polar coordinates (using radius and angle)

???

- Uses something called "great circles"



---
# Calculating Distances

???

- Most software that works with spatial data should autoamtically handle this.

- But, like plotting, it's something to be aware of.
